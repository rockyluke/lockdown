## Context

We are  a French family living  in Amsterdam, Netherlands since  March 2014. My
wife gave birth to our son in September  2018. Last but least I am a smoker and
I  decided to  reduce my  consumption to  5 cigarettes  a day  (usually 20)  to
preserve myself a bit (no comments).

We decided with my wife to create a very simple and short diary of the lockdown
on GitHub to share it easily with our friends and familly.

## 2020-03-12 - Day 00

Following the quick  spread of **COVID-19** in Netherlands, we  decided with my
wife to start the  lockdown on the `Thursday, March 12th 2020`.  By the way our
son is 1.5 year old today.

## 2020-03-13 - Day 01

First day  without bringing our  son to  childcare. Everything feels  normal at
home for him  and I guess he  thinks we are Saturday or  Sunday.  Everything is
also good at work. Our son start to be a bit sick wihtout any fever.

## 2020-03-14 - Day 02

A regular Saturday  is split in two part:  my wife take care of our  son in the
morning,   they   tend   to   go   out  for   2   hours   mainly   walking   in
[Beatrixpark](https://www.amsterdam.info/parks/beatrixpark/) and I take care of
him in  the afternoon,  we tend to  go out  for 2 hours  mainly walking  in [De
Pijp](https://www.amsterdam.info/depijp/).  We decided to reduce time out to 30
minutes walk in our Neiborhood. At the end  of the day our son was happy and go
to bed pretty easily. Our son is now coughing pretty hard.

## 2020-03-15 - Day 03
    
A regular Sunday looks like a Saturday  in terms of dispatch but we usually try
to visit a place or museum. We decided again to go out two times for 30 minutes
walk. Our son start to be really sick is still coughing pretty hard but without
any fever.  We still don't know  if it's a  regular cold or something  else. We
decided to apply some  old fashion medicines like an onion  in his bedroom, oil
and  good  food.   My  wife  work  for  [Cocolis](https://www.cocolis.fr/)  and
received a late call saying that it will  be hard time for the company which is
the  [BlaBlaCar](https://www.blablacar.com/)  of customer  delivery.   coughing
pretty hard but without any fever.

## 2020-03-16 - Day 04

First day working from home with our son also at home. Let the party begin! Our
son is  still happy  to be at  home with  his parents. My  wife explain  me the
protocol  to  go out  to  buy  new groceries:  when  it's  done, we  must  drop
everything in  front of  the house,  get undressed, clean  our clothes,  take a
shower, clean all  groceries with white vineger (ALL!!!) and  finally clean our
house entrance.  It still  looks crazy for me but I agree  to that.  Work feels
really  strange,  everything  is  slow   and  people  are  less  responsibe  as
usual. Something changed. As our son is still sick but wihtout fever we decided
to treat him with natural vitamins (fresh orange juice) and honey.

## 2020-03-17 - Day 05

It  feel  like  a normal  day  at  work  but  now everybody  is  talking  about
**COVID019**. We are sharing some tips  about confined life in differents Slack
channels. Our son is still sick but  looks better. My mom now calls us everyday
to check our son healthstate.

## 2020-03-18 - Day 06

I (re)install most of the [Blizzard](https://www.blizzard.com/) games including
StarCraft (Remastered) and Warcraft 3 (Reforged)  and we create a Whatsapp chat
with my friends to organise our games.

## 2020-03-19 - Day 07

Our son cry a  lot during the day and don't really want  to sleep.  I think the
next weeks will be  hard. It feels hard to write today but  work was *fine* and
home *fine* but not so quiet for a remote worker.

## 2020-03-20 - Day 08

The is still no official lockdown  in Netherlands and life outside seems really
*normal* except bars and restaurants are  now officialy closed.  Our son is not
sick anymore but is still coughing pretty  hard at night when sleeping. My wife
and I feel tired, I guess we are  missing sun and exercise. I know it's bad but
I ordered lots of  new items for our smart home and for  our sons on Amazon. He
get bored by everything  in less than 10 minutes now and it  is now really hard
to keep him busy. My wife start to work again.

## 2020-03-21 - Day 09

Our son  start to be  very pissed  by the lockdown  and is really  grumpy. It's
almost impossible  to say **no** to  something without 30 minutes  of cries. We
made during the last  week a list of nice groceries we need  to enjoy a bit the
lockdown, including  beer, wine and  cheese. Let's get  quickly out and  try to
made the lockdown  more a bit more  funny. Especially because our  son start to
make our life quite hard.

## 2020-03-22 - Day 10

To be  honest today was a  tough day. I went  outside for the first  time in 10
days    and   walked    with    our    son   for    almost    two   hours    in
[Beatrixpark](https://www.amsterdam.info/parks/beatrixpark/) to try to ease him
a bit.  Guess what? It didn't  really work...  I consider our family privileged
as we  lived in a  95m2 appartement but  now we start to  feel a bit  tight. We
did't have a minute for us except when he is sleeping, so I did my first nap in
10 days. We argue a bit with my wife  as I think our house rules are too strict
and  it made  me easily  angry. We  made a  video meeting  with our  friends in
Amsterdam and Paris and it was a really nice moment, thanks @ftrecourt. My wife
is really exhausted today  and started to cough a lot. I think  we will have to
dedicate a complete  room to our son because  at the end of the  day our entire
home looks like a kid room and it makes me pissed.
